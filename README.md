## General info

The goal for this project was to use my javascript skills to make a random string generator that pulls data from three different sources.
The three different sources i used are three arrays. One with jokes, one with songs and one with funny quotes i got from the internet that are generated by A.I
The project tasks did not include the need to use html and css, but i incorporated these technologies in my project to challenge my own skills

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Boostrap 4.5
